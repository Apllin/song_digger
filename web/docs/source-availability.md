## tl;dr

[scoring.md](scoring.md) describes a multi-source RRF pipeline, and the
code path is wired exactly that way. **As of 2026-05-11, the active
contributors are: YouTube Music Radio, Cosine.club (post-API
migration), Last.fm, and trackid.net.** Cosine.club moved to a new
public API at `https://cosine.club/api` (the previous `api.cosine.club`
host went NXDOMAIN — the adapter was rewritten to point at the new
endpoint and no longer returns BPM/key/energy/label/genre, which the
pipeline no longer uses anyway — see ADR-0016 and ADR-0019). The Bandcamp `/similar` adapter
was removed in ADR-0023 ahead of a SoundCloud replacement (stage 2);
the web-side Bandcamp scraper + mp3-extraction player path was kept
as the second-attempt branch in `lib/embed-resolver.ts`, so non-YTM
tracks that YTM exact-match can't resolve still get a chance at
inline playback before falling through to "unavailable". Last.fm uses
`track.getSimilar` for Artist–Track queries and falls back
unconditionally to `artist.getSimilar` → `artist.getTopTracks` (top-3
per similar artist, capped at 30) when track-level returns empty or
the query is artist-only — see ADR-0022.
Trackid.net
was rewritten as a JSON API client (playlists-list flow over three
public endpoints — `/musictracks`, `/audiostreams?musicTrackId=`,
`/audiostreams/<slug>` — with `±5` window in up to 15 fresh sets) and
enabled by default — see ADR-0014; the previous HTML-scraping attempt
failed because trackid.net is a React SPA with no server-rendered
tracklist HTML. The Beatport adapter was removed in ADR-0015 — once
BPM/key left the pipeline (ADR-0016) it had no remaining purpose.
Yandex is still a no-op without a token. 1001tracklists was removed in
Stage A.5 v2 (see ADR-0012).

This is not a code bug. The aggregator and the adapter wiring are
correct. It's an external-services bill of health.

## Per-source status

| Source | Status | Symptom | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cosine_club` | ✓ Works (post-API migration 2026-05) | New public API at `https://cosine.club/api` — two-step `/v1/search` → `/v1/tracks/{id}/similar`. Returns rank + YouTube URLs only; BPM/key/energy/label/genre are no longer in the public schema. The previous `api.cosine.club` host went NXDOMAIN; the adapter was rewritten to use the new endpoint. Requires `COSINE_CLUB_API_KEY`. | Watch for `[CosineClub] find_similar error:` log lines indicating the schema or auth shape shifted again. |
| `bandcamp` | ⛔ Removed from `/similar` (ADR-0023, 2026-05-11) — ✓ Kept as YTM-fallback embed | The Python adapter and the bandcamp `SourceList` are gone from `/similar`. The web-side surface (`web/lib/scrapers/bandcamp.ts` + `useBandcampAudio` hook + `<audio>` element + `frame-src https://bandcamp.com` + `media-src https://*.bcbits.com`) was kept as the second-attempt branch in `embed-resolver.ts`: when YTM exact-match misses, the resolver searches Bandcamp's public `bcsearch_public_api` for a match and returns its EmbeddedPlayer / mp3 stream. Results land in `TrackEmbed` with `source="bandcamp"`, so the per-(title, artist) Bandcamp probe amortizes across users. | Watch for `[Bandcamp] search error:` or `[Bandcamp] extract audio error:` log lines indicating Imperva expanded the challenge to the search API or the `data-tralbum` mp3 selector changed. If the player fallback dies too, drop it and live with "unavailable" until SoundCloud (stage 2) lands. |
| `yandex_music` | ⚠ No-op without token | `YANDEX_MUSIC_TOKEN` env var is unset; adapter early-returns `[]`. Documented behavior, but the env is empty in the dev `.env`. | Set the token if the developer has a Yandex account. Cheapest single improvement to source diversity. |
| `lastfm` | ✓ Works | `track.getSimilar` populates the primary list for Artist–Track queries. When that returns empty, OR when the input is artist-only (no `" - Track"`), the adapter falls back unconditionally to `artist.getSimilar` → top-3 per similar artist, capped at 30. Requires `LASTFM_API_KEY`. Per-artist similars cached in `LastfmArtistSimilars` (30-day TTL). See ADR-0022. | Watch for `[Lastfm]` log prefixes; nothing user-facing fails when the API key is missing (adapter early-returns `[]`). |
| `trackidnet` | ✓ Active (JSON API, playlists-list flow, verified 2026-05-04) | `trackidnet_enabled = True` default. Adapter uses three public JSON endpoints (no auth, no Cloudflare cookie): `/api/public/musictracks?keywords=` (search), `/api/public/audiostreams?musicTrackId=` (lightweight playlists list), `/api/public/audiostreams/<slug>` (per-playlist tracklist). Per-seed flow: search → pick best catalogue entry → list playlists for seed id (cap 15, sorted by `addedOn` desc) → fetch each tracklist concurrently (`Semaphore(5)`) → for each, take ±5 tracks around the seed → aggregate by slug across all windows, sort by count desc then `referenceCount` asc. The previous HTML scraper was abandoned because trackid.net is a React SPA. See ADR-0014. | Watch for `[Trackidnet] search failed`, `[Trackidnet] playlists list failed`, or `[Trackidnet] audiostream <slug> failed` log lines indicating the JSON shape changed or the endpoint moved behind auth. |
| `youtube_music` | ✓ Works | The most consistently-producing adapter — 10+ results per seed via the YTM Radio playlist. | — |

## Re-validation commands

Run these before relying on this document for new decisions:

```bash
# 1. Cosine.club API reachability
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "https://cosine.club/api/v1/docs"
# Expected when healthy: 200.

# 2. Yandex token
grep -c '^YANDEX_MUSIC_TOKEN=' .env
```

## Triage tasks

1. **Yandex token.** Easy win if the developer has an account.
2. **Stage 2 — SoundCloud replacement.** Bandcamp's `/similar`
   adapter was removed in ADR-0023; the web-side Bandcamp embed
   fallback stays until SoundCloud lands. The SoundCloud adapter is
   the planned replacement; new ADR will land with the wiring.
